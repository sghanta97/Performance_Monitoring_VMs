# Performance_Monitoring_VMs
Write a python application to monitor VCPU and VMEM of all VMs. Your application should the following:
  (a) print all VMs in ascending order, based on CPU /memory usage.
  (b) print and also log in an alert message (Vm name, time stamp, CPU usage) if CPU  usage crossed a threshold T (take from user input).The TA will give CPU or MEM as the argument to your program and your program should return the list of VMs sorted by the given argument.
Bonus (10 Additional points): Your program should also make a sorted list of moving averages for all VMs. The polling interval + moving window size should be user defined parameter
