# Performance_Monitoring_VMs
A python application to monitor VCPU and VMEM of all VMs. This application would:
  (a) print all VMs in ascending order, based on CPU /memory usage.  
  (b) print and also log in an alert message (Vm name, time stamp, CPU usage) if CPU  usage crossed a threshold T (taken from user input).<br/> 
Bonus (10 Additional points): Your program should also make a sorted list of moving averages for all VMs. The polling interval + moving window size should be user defined parameter
